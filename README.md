# EE3801 Data Engineering Principles Labs
My EE3801 Data Engineering Principles lab sumissions

## What I learned from Lab 1
1. In pandas, operations are usually done along an entire axis, therefore there's no need to use a loop.
1. Moreover, a pandas method usually creates a new DataFrame rather than modify the original, making loops extremely expensive.

## What I learned from Lab 2
1. DataFrame and Series can use pyplot methods directly, however the return type is `matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot`, so if the pyplot method returns something useful it would be better to use it instead.

## What I learned from Lab 5 (picasso)
1. You need a lot of RAM to do data processing.
2. Using vectorisation, you can plot lines (or maybe rectangles?) perpendicular to an axis with a single function call.

NOTE: Original folder structure had to be retained for this lab hence the folder is not named Lab 5. The rest of this module is at [PyHipp](https://github.com/shenghaoc/PyHipp)
